# SpeedTest
Simple Lightweight Internet Speed Test Using HTML &amp; JavaScript
This SpeedTest if free of Flash, Java, Websocket. Just pure HTML & JavaScript.

The code and project was done by https://github.com/adolfintel at https://github.com/adolfintel/speedtest. Mine is just an update and a try to make the Test Beautiful and Mobile Responsive.
The Code was made Beautiful and Mobile Resonsive using Skeleton https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton, and Bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com.


# Requirements

- A reasonably fast web server. PHP is optional but recommended.
- Some way to generate garbage data..
- Your server must accept large POST requests (up to 20 Megabytes), otherwise the upload test will fail.
- It's also better if your server does not use compression, but it's not mandatory
